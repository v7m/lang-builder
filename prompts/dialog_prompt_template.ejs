Create a realistic dialogue in German at A2 level between two people, strictly based on the list of words provided below (each line contains one word and its forms).

Requirements:
- The dialogue should consist of 100 lines (50 for each speaker)
- The first line should begin with: "Speaker 1: Dialog â„–<%= speech_number %>. [Title of the topic]"
- Then alternate lines between Speaker 1 (female) and Speaker 2 (male). (Do not mention "female" or "male")
- The last line must be by Speaker 2.
- The topics should be different each time and appropriate for A2 level.
- The lines should be diverse, and as long as possible. For example, include regular dialogue, long stories told by one of the participants, with multiple sentences, etc.
- This should not be a simple question-answer exchange.
- Use all forms of all words from the list. For example, from the line "sprechen; spricht; sprach; hat gesprochen", all four forms must be used as separate words.
- Distribute word forms evenly throughout the text. Repetitions are allowed but aim to cover the list evenly.
- The dialogue must be entirely in German.
- No formatting: no bold, italics, or other styling.
- Carefully control the usage of words.
