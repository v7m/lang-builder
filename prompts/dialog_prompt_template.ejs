You are an assistant that outputs structured JSON data only.

Create a realistic dialogue in German at A2 level between two people, strictly based on the list of words (each line contains one word and its forms).

Return the result **only** as a valid JSON object with the following fields:
- "dialog": an array where each item is an object with:
  - "id": the line number (from 1 to <%= number_of_lines %>),
  - "speaker": either "Speaker 1" or "Speaker 2",
  - "text": the content of the line (without speaker prefix).
- "word_forms_usage": an object where:
  - keys are all word forms from the input list (each form separately)
  - values are numbers indicating how many times each form was used in the dialogue

### Requirements:
- You must generate exactly <%= number_of_lines %> lines of dialogue.
- Each line must be one item in the "dialog" array.
- You MUST count them before returning your result. Do not return fewer than <%= number_of_lines %> items. This is required.
- The first line must be: "Dialog №<%= speech_number %>. [Title of the topic]" — as text in the `"text"` field of the first object.
- Alternate between speakers. Speaker 1 starts first, and Speaker 2 ends last.
- Use diverse sentence structures and longer statements when possible.
- This is **not** a simple Q&A dialogue — include stories, longer responses, elaborations, etc.
- The topic must be appropriate for A2 level and unique each time.

### Dialogue Structure Rules:
- At least **10–15 lines** must be **mini-stories** or detailed monologues by either speaker.
- A mini-story should consist of **3 to 6 full, connected sentences**, describing:
  - past events,
  - personal experiences,
  - trips or dreams,
  - problems or memorable situations.
- These mini-stories must be naturally integrated and **spread throughout** the dialogue — beginning, middle, and end.
- Avoid repetitive or disconnected short question-answer lines. The dialogue should feel like a natural, rich conversation.

### Vocabulary Usage:
- Use **all forms** of **all** words from the list. For example:
  - for the line "sprechen; spricht; sprach; hat gesprochen", use **each** form at least once;
  - for the line "der Stadtteil; Stadtteile", use both singular (Stadtteil) and plural (Stadtteile) forms.
- Distribute word forms **evenly** across the entire dialogue — don't group them all at the beginning or end.
- Reusing word forms in different contexts is encouraged for better practice.

- The dialogue must be entirely in **German**.
- Do not include any formatting (no bold, italics, line breaks, etc.).
- Do not include any explanation or non-JSON text in the output.

### Example of input:
"der Stadtteil; Stadtteile; \n sprechen; spricht; sprach; hat gesprochen \n"

### Output Format:

Return a valid JSON object like this:

{
  "dialog": [
    {"id": 1, "speaker": "Speaker 1", "text": "Dialog №123. Im Stadtteil"},
    {"id": 2, "speaker": "Speaker 2", "text": "Hallo! Wie findest du unseren Stadtteil?"},
    ...
  ],
  "word_forms_usage": {
    "Stadtteil": 2,
    "Stadtteile": 1,
    "sprechen": 1,
    "spricht": 2,
    "sprach": 1,
    "hat gesprochen": 1
  }
}
