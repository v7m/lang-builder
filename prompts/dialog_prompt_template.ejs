You are an assistant that outputs structured JSON data only.

Create a realistic dialogue in German at A2-B1 level between two people, strictly based on the list of words (each line contains one word and its forms).

### Input Format:
Each line in the input represents ONE word with ALL its forms:
- Verbs: all 4 forms separated by semicolons
  Example: "sprechen; spricht; sprach; hat gesprochen"
- Nouns: singular and plural forms separated by semicolons
  Example: "der Stadtteil; Stadtteile"
- Separable verbs: forms with dot showing separation point
  Example: "ein·tragen; trägt ein; trug ein; hat eingetragen"
- Other parts of speech: one or more forms
  Example: "charmant" or "gut; besser; am besten"

Return the result **only** as a valid JSON object with the following fields:
- "dialog": an array where each item is an object with:
  - "id": the line number (from 1 to N),
  - "speaker": either "Speaker 1" or "Speaker 2",
  - "text": the content of the line (without speaker prefix).
- "wordFormsUsage": an object where:
  - keys are the EXACT input lines (with all forms)
  - values show how many times ANY form from that line was used

### Critical Requirements (MUST be met before returning result):
1. Dialogue Length:
  - MINIMUM <%= minNumberOfLines %> lines is REQUIRED
  - You MUST count lines before returning
  - If you need more lines to use all word forms, INCREASE the length
  - NEVER return fewer than <%= minNumberOfLines %> lines

2. Word Forms Usage:
  - For EACH INPUT LINE, use AT LEAST ONE of its forms:
    - For verbs (e.g., "sprechen; spricht; sprach; hat gesprochen"): use ANY 1 of 4 forms
    - For nouns (e.g., "der Stadtteil; Stadtteile"): use EITHER singular OR plural
    - For adjectives/adverbs: use ANY available form
    - For other parts of speech: use ANY available form
  - Count in wordFormsUsage when ANY form from the line is used
  - Before returning, verify that each INPUT LINE has count >= 1
  - Add more lines if needed to use at least one form from each input line

3. First and Last Lines:
  - First line MUST be: "Dialog №<%= speechNumber %>. [Title of the topic]"
  - Last line MUST be a proper dialogue ending
  - Speaker 1 starts first, Speaker 2 ends last

### Dialogue Structure Rules:
- At least **10–15 lines** must be **mini-stories** or detailed monologues by either speaker
- A mini-story should consist of **3 to 6 full, connected sentences**, describing:
  - past events,
  - personal experiences,
  - trips or dreams,
  - problems or memorable situations
- These mini-stories must be naturally integrated and **spread throughout** the dialogue — beginning, middle, and end
- Avoid repetitive or disconnected short question-answer lines
- Make it a natural, rich conversation with context and details
- Use diverse sentence structures
- The dialogue must be entirely in German
- No formatting (no bold, italics, line breaks)
- No explanation or non-JSON text in output

### Final Verification Steps:
1. Count total lines (must be >= <%= minNumberOfLines %>)
2. Check that EACH WORD (line in input) is used at least once in ANY form
3. Verify speaker alternation
4. Verify proper beginning and ending

Return a valid JSON object like this:
{
  "dialog": [
    {"id": 1, "speaker": "Speaker 1", "text": "Dialog №123. Im Stadtteil"},
    {"id": 2, "speaker": "Speaker 2", "text": "Hallo! Wie findest du unseren Stadtteil?"},
    ...
  ],
  "wordFormsUsage": {
    "sprechen; spricht; sprach; hat gesprochen": 1,
    "der Stadtteil; Stadtteile": 2,
    "ein·tragen; trägt ein; trug ein; hat eingetragen": 1,
    "charmant": 1,
    "gut; besser; am besten": 2
  }
}
